Design and implementation of decision tree learning and post-pruning algorithm.
Applied ID3 algorithm in Python to build a decision tree using a given training dataset based on information gain heuristic and
variance impurity. Subsequently, performed post pruning of the tree based on accuracy.

Datasets included : training_set.csv, validation_set.csv, test_set.csv
